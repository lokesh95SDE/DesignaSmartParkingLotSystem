/**
 * COMPOSITION — "has-a" (strong ownership) relationship
 *
 * One object OWNS another. The contained object CANNOT exist without the container.
 * The container controls the lifecycle — it creates and destroys the contained objects.
 * If the container dies, all contained objects die too.
 *
 * Real-world analogy: A House has Rooms.
 * - Rooms are CREATED when the house is built.
 * - Rooms CANNOT exist without the house.
 * - If the house is demolished, all rooms are destroyed.
 * - You can't take a room and put it in another house!
 *
 * KEY CHARACTERISTICS:
 * - Strong "has-a" — container OWNS the parts
 * - Child lifecycle is DEPENDENT on parent
 * - Child is typically created INSIDE the parent (in constructor/methods)
 * - Deleting parent DELETES all children
 * - Child cannot belong to multiple parents simultaneously
