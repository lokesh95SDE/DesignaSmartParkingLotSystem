/**
 * ASSOCIATION — "uses-a" relationship
 *
 * Two objects are RELATED but completely INDEPENDENT.
 * Neither owns the other. Both can exist on their own.
 * They interact/collaborate but don't control each other's lifecycle.
 *
 * Real-world analogy: A Doctor treats a Patient.
 * - Doctor exists without Patient, Patient exists without Doctor.
 * - They interact during consultation but neither "owns" the other.
 * - A Doctor can treat many Patients, a Patient can visit many Doctors.
 *
 * KEY CHARACTERISTICS:
 * - No ownership
 * - Both objects have independent lifecycles
 * - Can be one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many
 * - Weakest relationship of the three
