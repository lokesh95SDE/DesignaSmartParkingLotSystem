/**
 * AGGREGATION — "has-a" (weak ownership) relationship
 *
 * One object CONTAINS another, but the contained object can exist INDEPENDENTLY.
 * The container doesn't control the lifecycle of the contained object.
 * If the container is destroyed, the contained objects SURVIVE.
 *
 * Real-world analogy: A Cricket Team has Players.
 * - The team "has" players, but players exist outside the team too.
 * - If the team is disbanded, players still exist — they join other teams.
 * - Players are NOT created by the team; they are added from outside.
 *
 * KEY CHARACTERISTICS:
 * - Weak "has-a" — container has a reference, not ownership
 * - Child object's lifecycle is INDEPENDENT of parent
 * - Child is typically created OUTSIDE and passed IN (via constructor/setter)
 * - Deleting parent does NOT delete children
